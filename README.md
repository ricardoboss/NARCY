Not A Real Computer Yet

## What's this?

This is my second attempt to create a microprocessor with its own instruction set, assembly language and (maybe) a
programming language.

My first attempt was successful, but very limited. It was comparable to an early microprocessor in the late 1960s and
couldn't do much. I had developed an assembly language and a Java compiler for converting it into a hex dump, which
could then be imported into ROM run in Logisim. It featued no external ports, 3 general purpose registers and the only
program I wrote for it filled the RAM with increasing numbers (i.e. the address corresponded to the value). It wasn't
much, but it already supported jumps!

This version shall be more advanced (no guarantees, tho).
